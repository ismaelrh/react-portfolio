# React-portfolio

Serverless web portfolio that I created to show my profile, projects and hackathons.
Created with React and Bootstrap 4, and bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run it in development mode, just type `npm start` in the project folder. To minimize and create deploy-files, type `npm build`. Then, the code to be placed in your HTML server will be located on `build` folder.
